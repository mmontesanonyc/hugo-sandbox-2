insects that feed mainly on human blood They are often confused with other insects and many people are not even aware of their presence until they have been bitten However not everyone has a reaction

mattresses box springs chairs or other materials Bed bugs spread mainly by hitchhiking onto furniture luggage and clothing and by travelling along spaces that connect apartments and rooms in commercial and institutional settings Effective control requires cooperation with your neighbors landlord and pest management provider It is hard but not impossible to get rid of bed bugs Do not try to get rid of them on your own Get help from a welltrained and licensed pest management professional Anyone can get bed bugs Seek help immediately if you find them Bed Bugs and Health Although bed bugs and their bites are a nuisance they are not known to spread disease Other healthrelated consequences have been noted Bed bug bites can be very itchy and irritating Most welts heal in a few days but in unusual cases the welt may persist for several weeks An antiitching ointment can help but if bites become infected people should see their doctor The anxiety about being bitten can lead to sleeplessness which can affect wellbeing Properly and effectively responding to bed bugs helps to keep anxiety in check Some people become so desperate that they use illegal or excessive amounts of pesticides which can lead to poisonings About the Data and Indicators Estimates of numbers and percentages of adults reporting bed bugs in their homes are measured using survey data The accuracy of the survey data depends on the participants ability to recall and correctly report the presence of bed bugs Prevention and Control In New York City building owners are required by law to provide apartments free of pests but residents can also take steps to prevent the spread of bed bugs Never bring bed frames mattresses box springs or upholstered furniture found on the street into your home and check all used or rented furniture for bed bugs When traveling inspect the bed and furniture Keep suitcases off the floor and bed and inspect them before you leave If you suspect you have been around bed bugs immediately wash and dry your clothing on hot settings or store items in a sealed plastic bag until you can Seal cracks and crevices with caulk even if you dont have bed bugs This will help prevent pests from coming in and spreading to other locations Do not use pesticide bombs or foggers to control pests because they can make conditions worse Get professional help to control bed

Defects Birth defects also called congenital malformations are conditions that happen when a baby does not develop normally during pregnancy Structural defects may include missing limbs malformed

happen during the first three months of pregnancy and are detected within the first year of life Some birth defects such as cleft liphttpa816dohbespnycgovIndicatorPublicGlossaryaspxCleftLip or clubfoot are easy to see but others such as heart defects or hearing loss are found using special tests such as xrays CT scans or hearing tests Birth defects can vary from mild to severe This site provides data on NYC children born with one or more of 12 major birth defects Each of the 12 birth defects is defined in the glossary on this site The data comes from the NYS Department of Health Congenital Malformations Registryhttpwwwhealthstatenyusdiseasescongenitalmalformationscmrhomehtm Birth Defects and the Environment Scientists believe most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors including our genes behaviors and environment However the causes of most birth defects are unknown The fetus is more sensitive to exposures than an adult and if exposures happen during important periods of development birth defects may result Although there has been some research into how environmental exposures might cause birth defects there is still much more work that needs to be done to understand the relationship of these exposures to birth defects Known and probable risk factors for birth defects include the following smoking use of alcohol and other drugs poor nutrition andor health such as low levels of folic acid obesity and poorly controlled diabetes some medicines prescription overthecounter toxic chemicals such as lead paint and paint thinner gasoline pesticides and secondhand smoke infectious agents such as rubella and toxoplasmosis and ionizing radiation xrays About the Data and Indicators Collecting and sharing good data about the occurrence of birth defects is a first step in understanding how they might be related to the environment Looking at patterns of birth defect rates can help health officials plan services and create ideas for research into environmental causes of birth defects All birth defects in any child less than two years old are reportable under New York State law to the State Congenital Malformations Registry Most birth defect reports are abstracted from inpatient hospital records since birth defects diagnosed on an outpatient basis are not well reported Accurate hospital clinical recognition of birth defects depends on clinical expertise and interest This is particularly true of conditions more difficult to diagnose As a result identification of birth defects may vary by area and by time Areas with hospitals that provide higher levels of care may have more thorough diagnoses and thus apparently higher rates Similarly areas with hospitals that report cases more completely will also appear to have higher rates Prevention Not all birth defects can be prevented but actions that increase the chance of having a healthy baby include Have regular medical checkups and check with a provider before taking any medications Eat healthy foods and maintain a healthy weight avoid alcohol and dont use street drugs Make sure that medical conditions like diabetes are under control Take a vitamin with folic acid before and during pregnancy Quit smoking and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke Damaged leadcontaining paint in homes should be safely addressed by properly trained workers ideally prior to pregnancy

Restricting to term pregnancies removes the majority of low birth weight babies who are small because they were born preterm and did not have time to finish growing before birth Historically the ratio of male to female births has been about 105 Some have hypothesized that exposure to certain chemicals in the environment can reduce the number of male births so sex ratio may be a useful environmental

tracking the number of brownfield sites that currently exist and the number that have been successfully cleaned up through an official city state or federal program Brownfields in New York City The NYC Office of Environmental Remediation OER was created to help identify brownfields and assist with their cleanup As part of its efforts OER has developed a Vacant Property Database VPD to help developers identify vacant commercial and industrial properties that may be available for redevelopment and to provide basic data on past property usage and environmental features As of 2011 NYC had between 1500 and 2000 potential brownfields based on a review of vacant properties historic filling patterns and other environmental features in the VPD The VPD assesses potential or actual contamination on vacant properties which are only a fraction of the total property stock in NYC Thus new brownfield sites will continue to emerge as buildings reach the end of their use cycle and are rebuilt Our target is to ultimately reduce the number of brownfields in NYC to zero Brownfield Site Remediation The PlaNYC goal is to provide the necessary resources to enable brownfields to be

environmental factors related to childhood cancers because like adult cancer they are likely to be the result of a mix of genetic environmental and behavioral causes and not just one factor by itself Exposures to the parent the fetus in the womb or the child after birth may all play a role Some risk factors that explain a small percentage of cases include Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation Genetic abnormalities and conditions including Down Syndrome Exposure to chemotherapy drugs known as alkylating agents About the Data and Indicators Data are reported over fiveyear periods because the number of cases and rates for single years can vary considerably particularly for less common types of cancer Counts and rates are calculated based upon residential address at time of diagnosis Because cancer latencies can be long the neighborhood of residence at the time of diagnosis may not be the same as the residence at the time an earlier exposure may have occurred All cancers diagnosed among NYS residents are required by law to be reported to the NYS Cancer Registry The registry is considered to have 95 or higher case ascertainment The cancer indicators included in this portal were chosen by a National workgroup of the Tracking Network because they are potentially related to environmental exposures or there is public concern that they may be related Prevention The risk of many adult cancers can be reduced by certain lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight or quitting smoking Less is known about ways to prevent cancer in children The good news is that there are effective treatments for many childhood cancers Since the 1970s death rates have declined dramatically and survival rates have increased for most childhood cancers Key Messages In NYC

hands toys and pacifiers often Do not use imported foods spices clay pots and dishesmedicines toys and cosmetics that have been found to contain lead All children should be tested for lead poisoning at ages one and two Health care providers should also test other children found to be at risk and annually assess children from six months to six years of age for lead exposure risk Key Messages Childhood lead poisoning in NYC has declined dramatically over the last decade The main source of childhood lead poisoning in the United States is leadbased paint in older deteriorated housing Chipping flaking and peeling paint and paint disturbed during home remodeling contributes to lead dust and contaminates bare soil around a home Children can be exposed by eating leadbased paint chips chewing on objects painted with leadbased paint or swallowing house dust or soil that contains lead Information on other sources of lead poisoning can be found

Climate and Weather A regions climate is characterized by its usual weather conditions seasons and patterns in extreme weather events like heat waves droughts and hurricanes The worlds climate is shifting becoming warmer with more precipitation and weather extremes Over the past century in New York City average temperatures have increased by 025F per decade precipitation by 072 inches per decade and sea levels by 12 inches per decade By the 2020s a projected 2530 days above 90F are expected in a typical summer resulting in more frequent and intense heat waves Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase by up to 5 together with another 10 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding NYC Panel on Climate Change Climate Risk Information 2009 Climate and Health Even without long term changes in climate New Yorkers face weatherrelated risks today Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer In fact more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined both in direct mortality from heat stress hyperthermia also known as heat stroke and by way of increases in the usual rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions While less common coastal storms also have imparted serious consequences throughout history and in recent years most notably Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 from their devastating direct costs in over 1800 lives along the Gulf Coast to longterm mental health consequences among survivors In 2011 Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive flooding throughout the Northeast and is estimated to be one of the costliest disasters in US history though New York City was largely spared The health impacts of weather events and climate change may be further compounded by power outages arising during heat waves and coastal storms Such effects include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage acute carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure lack of air conditioning inability to obtain medical care or extreme exertion such as having to climb many flights of stairs due to elevator outages About the Data and Indicators The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat Increases in naturalcause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves from cardiovascular disease diabetes and renal disease for example may be estimated using statistical methods Prevention Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults 65 years and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes mental illness or other cognitive impairment Some medications can increase heat risk talk to your doctor or pharmacist to learn more about medicationrelated risk and precautions to take during hot weather For air conditioners with a thermostat a setting of 78F is recommended to provide comfort while not wasting energy Check on those atrisk and assist them in staying cool and well hydrated Seek medical attention immediately if the victim has a rapid heart rate trouble breathing is no longer sweating displays very unusual behavior or loses consciousness Being prepared is key to weathering hurricanes and coastal storms safely Find out if you live in an evacuation zone and stay tuned to TV and radio

the water breathing water droplets or chemicals released from the water while showering or by absorbing chemicals through their skin while bathing Drinking water is disinfected to reduce the possibility of illness from microorganisms Disinfection byproducts DBPs are chemicals that can form when a disinfectant such as chlorine reacts with naturally occurring organic matter and other substances in the source water Current research is investigating whether there are health effects from chronic exposure to the byproducts of water disinfection Nitrates are nitrogenoxygen molecules commonly found in water where nitrogenbased fertilizers are used nearby Decades ago it was discovered that infants who were fed formula made with water containing nitrates over 10 mgL sometimes became seriously ill due to the interference of nitrate with the oxygencarrying capacity of blood Arsenic is naturallyoccurring in groundwater systems in some parts of the US It may also enter drinking water

Factors in the environment may contribute to both atherosclerosis and to the acute event itself This site provides data on hospitalizations for heart attack Heart Attacks and the Environment Genetics lifestyle and environmental factors can all contribute to an increased risk for heart attack In addition to lifestyle risk factors such as high LDL cholesterol high blood pressure obesity smoking lack of physical activity and diabetes exposure to certain ambient air pollutantshttpa816dohbespnycgovIndicatorPublicGlossaryaspxAirPollutant can also increase the risk of a heart attack Most ambient air pollutants originate from fossil fuel eg diesel gasoline fuel oil and coal combustion Secondhand smoke is the single largest contributor to indoor air pollution Studies suggest that exposure to

Neighborhoods Housing and Neighborhoods OneNYChttpwww1nycgovhtmlonenycindexhtml is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York Citys future Goal Create homes for nearly a million more New Yorkers while making housing and neighborhoods more affordable and sustainable Housing Supply We are tracking the number of new housing units created since the start of the plan in 2007 as well as the size of the total housing stock to ensure that the city is meeting the supply portion of its goal The nearly one million New Yorkers projected to be added to the citys population between 2005 and 2030 will require 314000 new units of housing To track the creation of new units we look at housing completion data ie the number of newly issued Certificates of Occupancy including Temporary Certificates of Occupancy These indicate that a new residential unit is ready for occupancy Certificates of Occupancy document new units added through new construction but they do not account for demolition of existing units units created or lost through changes of use eg loft conversions or subdivisions or mergers of existing units Thus it is an incomplete measure of net additions to total housing supply To get a greater sense of how supply is changing we also track the number of existing units of housing stock in NYC from the triennial Housing and Vacancy Survey HVS Housing Affordability We are tracking housing affordability by looking at two indicators 1 the number of new units of housing affordable to the typical NYC household and 2 the vacancy rate of apartments across different rental rates To calculate the first indicator we look at the total number of housing units for rent and then what percentage of those units would be affordable to a household earning the median income in that year For example in 2008 the median income of a household in NYC was 45000 according to the HVS which translates to affordable monthly housing costs of no more than 1125 30 of the monthly gross income for that household This indicator tells us about the changing cost of housing and how changes in income relate to the changing cost of housing If housing was becoming more affordable in NYC we would expect the amount of housing available to a typical New Yorker to increase To calculate the second indicator we look at the net rental vacancy rates across different price categories In general the vacancy rate tells us about the relationship between supply and demand Vacancy rates below 5 indicate a housing emergency very low supply andor very high demand Typically vacancy rates in NYC are higher for luxury and more expensive apartments while they are lower for less expensive apartments indicating a relative shortage of adequate inexpensive housing options PlaNYC seeks to increase the availability of inexpensive housing which would be indicated by a higher vacancy rate for lower rent market segments Housing Sustainability We are looking at both access to transit for work and nonwork trips as well as energy usage to track whether NYC is meeting the sustainability portion of our housing goals For the transit criteria we look at the percentage of new building permits issued for residential units that are located within a 12 mile of a transit node eg subway stop commuter rail station Access to transit options will enable future New Yorkers to live more sustainably At the inception of PlaNYC 69 of building permits issued for residential units in the city were within a mile of transit and our aim is to increase this amount Reaching this goal is facilitated by the NYC zoning strategy which upzones areas close to transit to allow additional density Meanwhile areas far from transit are downzoned which has the simultaneous impact of preserving the character of those neighborhoods The number of permits issued should not however be equated with housing completion data We measure the energy used per capita by NYC residential buildings to track the energy intensity of our housing stock from year to year We expect residential energy usage and per capita GHG emissions to fall as the effects of the Greener Greater Buildings Bill passed December 2009 and other actions take effect"},{"title":"Housing","tags":null,"categories":[],"keywords":null,"indicators":[{"subtopic_id":36,"internal_id":2101,"name":"Adults Reporting Mold in the

source of childhood lead poisoning in NYC as in most of the United States is leadbased paint in older deteriorated housing Nationwide lead poisoning is associated with housing constructed before 1950 when leadbased paint was widely used and contained more lead than in later decades In 1960 NYC banned the use of leadbased paint in homes and a national ban went into effect in 1978 Older layers of lead paint may still be present in older buildings and can become a lead hazard when the paint chips peels or is abraded or when renovations or repairs are conducted without taking appropriate actions to control dust Families residing in older poorly maintained housing are at higher risk for lead poisoning Dust from leadbased paint can contaminate floors and windowsills and childrens hands and toys Young children who crawl on the floor and put their hands and toys in their mouths are at greatest risk for lead poisoning through swallowing lead dust Lead from sources other than paint may also present a hazard to children Information on other sources of lead poisoning can be found on the Health Departments website at Lead Hazards and Health People may be exposed to lead by absorbing breathing or swallowing lead or lead dust Children with lead poisoning may develop health learning and behavioral problems The health effects of lead exposure may persist long after the exposure has stopped and a childs blood lead level BLL has declined Fetal exposure to lead may also result in cognitive and developmental problems About the Data and Indicators The indicators in this section focus

and proactively evaluate the presence of rats in Bronx neighborhoods in a program referred to as rat indexing By rapidly notifying property owners providing detailed advice on how to improve conditions and by engaging the public the Department now encourages whole blocks and neighborhoods to simultaneously concentrate their resources to maximize the effect of extermination and cleanup

from an environmental source such as traffic construction industrial or recreation activities animals or peoples voices that is unwanted to the person who hears it Noise and the Environment Exposure to any noise has long been recognized as an important occupational health hazard in workplaces and is increasingly viewed as a prevalent urban environmental hazard associated with adverse psychosocial and physiologic health effects such as sleep disturbance higher blood pressure cardiovascular disease and impaired cognitive performance in children About the Data and Indicators This report defines disruptive noise exposure as any ambient noise from outside the home that disrupts activities such as watching television listening to the radio having a conversation or sleeping to the person who hears it FDNE is defined as experiencing noise disruption three or more times per week Like most cities in the United States New York City NYC does not systematically monitor ambient noise or the prevalence of noise disturbance However the city tracks noise complaints through the NYC 311 call system and enforces the New York City Noise Code 311 complaint data do not allow a full understanding of the burden of ambient noise because they may not capture information about all noise exposure some New Yorkers are more likely to call about noise and some types of noise are most likely to generate a complaint Thus to gain a better understanding of noise disturbance among all New Yorkers the Community Health Survey asked adults about how often they were disrupted by noise within the previous three months and about sources of disruptive noise Prevention To reduce environmental noise one can consider the following methods a Control at noise sources It is often a primary consideration to reduce noise at its source Whenever possible quieter working methods or technologies should be used b Noise reduction at the transmission path An obvious way of reducing noise is to separate the sources of noise from noise sensitive uses Options to avoid or minimize noise say through adopting alternative transport such as railway pedestrian link cycling path underground roads can also be considered at the early planning stage c Protection at the receiver end By arranging noise sensitive uses such as bedrooms facing away from the noise sources or acoustic insulation by good glazing the impact of noise on the receiver end can be reduced Key Messages Ambient noise in the home work or school often disrupts peoples concentration According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthhttpwwwcdcgovniosh ambient noise also affects peoples health by increasing general stress levels and aggravating stressrelated conditions such as high blood pressure coronary disease peptic ulcers and migraine headaches Continued exposure does not lead to habituation in fact the effects worsen The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthhttpwwwcdcgovniosh offers detailed guides on noise and hearing loss prevention"},{"title":"NYC Agency Pesticide

Transportationrelated Injuries About traffic injuries in New York City Traffic injuries are no accident Like other public health concerns they are preventable through data driven solutions In NYC traffic injuries which include injuries among pedestrians bicyclists motorcyclists and motor vehicle occupants are a leading cause of injuryrelated hospitalizations and emergency department visits In February 2014 NYC launched Vision Zerohttpwwwnycgovhtmlvisionzeropageshomehomehtml an action plan to reduce injuries and deaths on city streets Vision Zero is a multiagency effort incorporating road engineering traffic enforcement community outreach and education and policy work to make NYC streets safer Traffic Safety and the Environment Many factors contribute to traffic injuries including human vehicle and environmental factors The built environment influences traffic injury outcomes by shaping the actions of road users which can prevent crashes from happening as well as mitigating the effects of crashes when they do happen Built environment features such as road design and traffic calming strategies include pedestrian islands signal timing separated bicycle paths speed humps and bumps signage and more Environmental interventions can be tailored for a communitys specific needs to improve traffic safety and reduce injuries About the Data and Indicators Rates of traffic injuries provided here are based on all live transportationrelated injury discharges from a NYC hospital and include emergency department visits and hospitalizations among residents and nonresidents of NYC Neighborhood data are based on zip code of residence for NYC residents only who were discharged from a hospital located in NYC Crash locations are not available in these data Visits to emergency departments and hospital stays reflect injuries that require immediate medical treatment Minor injuries not treated at a hospital are not captured through emergency department and hospitalization data Data were obtained from the New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System SPARCS Transportationrelated injuries are defined by the International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification ICD10CM and were recently revised The revisions largely pertain to injuryrelated diagnostic codes including those that capture transportationrelated injuries allowing for better diagnosis The Centers for Disease Control and national epidemiologists provided guidance to DOHMH for enumerating new injury codes Because the two ICD systems differ in how they classify injuries current data and previously posted data are not comparable Data prior to 2016 are not shown because they use the older coding ICDCM schema Prevention Drivers should pay attention while driving and yield to pedestrians crossing the street Obey the speed limit Never drink and drive text and drive or talk on a cellphone while driving Pedestrians should cross at intersections with the light listen for traffic look both ways and put away phones or other distracting mobile devices Cyclists should wear a helmet and ride predictably with the direction of traffic Communitybased

OneNYChttpwww1nycgovhtmlonenycindexhtml is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York Citys future Goal Expand sustainable transportation choices and ensure the reliability and quality of our transportation network To measure progress towards this goal we are tracking the switch to more sustainable modes of transportation modal shift and mass transit capacity as well as whether our transportation system is meeting a state of good repair Modal Shift We are tracking the extent to which people are using nonautomobile modes of transit including public transportation eg bus subway bicycling and walking These alternative modes which use less land and create less pollution than automobiles result in less congestion and increased mobility for NYC residents To quantify the extent of the modal shift in NYC we measure the way people travel to the central business district Manhattan below 60th street as well as the way people travel citywide For travel to the central business district we look directly at changes in the percent of all trips that use nonautomobile modes of transit To track the switch to mass transit citywide we look at the relative growth of auto and transit travel demand Travel demand is highly correlated to economic activity during recessions it tends to go down and during periods of economic growth it increases To control for this economic impact we measure the relative changes in use of transit including nonmotorized travel and automobiles from the year 2000 Our goal is to increase the mass transit and nonmotorized share of travel in NYC both to the central business district and citywide Transit Capacity Increasing transit capacity will reduce traffic congestion by allowing more people to take mass transit To measure whether NYC has increased capacity we are tracking the number of transit vehicle revenue miles in the New York metropolitan area Vehicle revenue miles are miles that transit vehicles eg subway cars buses are scheduled or travel while in revenue service They do not include miles traveled without passengers or when returning to a storage depot Noncity agencies provide significant transit service to and from the city eg Long Island Rail Road Metro North Rail Road New Jersey Transit so we have included them in our computation We have also included all modes of mass transit eg bus tram ferry rail subway paratransit vehicles to ensure a complete view of transit capacity State of Good Repair Bridges and Roads NYC owns and maintains 786 bridges and related structures In the 70s and 80s the dire financial situation led to decisions to defer bridge maintenance which in turn led to declining conditions Today we apply lifecycle analyses to make strategic investments in maintenance and component replacement The approach has yielded better bridge conditions and longer life expectancy for some bridges which will both save NYC money in the long run and provide the highest safety and service for our customers The NYC Department of Transportation NYC DOT has spent 3 billion in capital construction on city bridges since 2000 With stepped up maintenance it has led to the near elimination of bridges in poor condition and an increase in bridges rated good or very good The NYC DOT goal under this program is to have all of its bridges rated in very good good or fair condition and none rated poor Bridges in fair condition or better receive routine maintenance and component replacement As they approach the low end of fair bridges are reconstructed or rehabilitated This is the most costeffective approach for the longterm maintenance of city bridges NYC DOT also tracks the road network on a biannual basis Street conditions are assessed on a scale of 110 Ratings of 7 or above indicate good condition while ratings below 7 qualify a street for resurfacing or reconstruction A certain number of streets will also be below 7 because of utility work or other issues unrelated to the road itself The goal is to have at least 85 of city streets rated at or above 7 which assumes that the remaining 15 can be scheduled for resurfacing within the next two years This translates to about 1050 lane miles resurfaced each year State of Good Repair Subway stations NYC Transits 468 passenger stations are used by millions of customers each day The system has 277 underground stations 142 on elevated structures and 49 on viaduct embankment or opencut structures In 2008 NYC Transit completed a comprehensive condition survey of all stations conducted by independent engineering consultants Over 14500

community Violence is a public health issue because it is a cause of morbidity and mortality leading to physical and emotional harm an increase in negative health outcomes premature death psychological trauma and persistent fear to individuals and communities Violence is also an equity issue because it disproportionately affects groups that have been oppressed due to their socioeconomic status raceethnicity sexual orientation gender identity geographic location or some combination of these factors Data from multiple sources illustrate tremendous disparities in the

neighborhoods And violence persists as a leading cause of premature death among NYCs men of color Factors that Contribute to Violence Restricting the explanation of disparities in violence to differences in individuals and group characteristics most affected by the violence only initiates bias and constrains problemsolving To understand what drives violence it is important to look at the context and systems within which it occurs and consider the negative impact that historic practices eg redlining and ongoing social structures eg institutional racism have on particular groups and communities For example racialized systems have created and upheld stereotypes that link Black men and criminalityhttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC5004736 while ignoring the imbalanced distribution of power and resources experienced by Black men and Black communities A myriad of social political economic historical and environmental factors contribute to violence These factors convey messages

Climate Weather and Health A regions climate is characterized by its usual weather conditions seasons and patterns in extreme weather events such as heat waves droughts and hurricanes New York City NYC faces public health risks from extreme weather events such as heat waves and coastal storms With climate change the severity of some of these risks will increase A 2013 New York City Panel on Climate Change NPCC report predicts that by the 2020s average summer temperatures in New York City will increase by 20F to 30F compared to a 19712000 baseline Heat waves will become more frequent intense and longer in duration Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase together with another 48 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding NPCC Climate Risk Information 2013 Weather and Health Even without longterm changes in climate New Yorkers face weatherrelated risks today Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer In fact more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined both in direct mortality from heat stress hyperthermia also known as heat stroke and by way of increases in the rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions While far less common coastal storms can also have serious consequences including longterm mental health impacts In 2012 Hurricane Sandy caused extensive flooding and damage in New York City and resulted in at least 44 deaths Power outages can also occur during heat waves and coastal storms Potential health impacts include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure and inability to obtain medical care or extreme exertion such as having to climb many flights of stairs in highrise buildings due to elevator outages Lack of air conditioning or home heat may also result in heat and coldrelated illnesses About the Data and Indicators The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat Increases in naturalcause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves from cardiovascular disease diabetes and renal disease for example may be estimated using statistical methods The Tracking Portal also provides counts and rates of hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for cold stress As with heat stress data is important to note that cold stress data reflect only a portion of the overall health impact and does not account for potential increases in hospital visits for other conditions that can be exacerbated by cold exposure such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease for example Prevention Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes mental illness or cognitive impairments Set air conditioners to 78F or lowcool to provide comfort while not wasting energy Check on family friends and neighbors atrisk and assist them in staying cool and well hydrated Living without heat or being outdoors in cold weather for a prolonged time can be dangerous Stay indoors as much as possible When outdoors wear layers of warm clothing and cover exposed skin If your home lacks heat get to a warm place if you can and wear warm clothes Report loss of heat or hot water to property managers immediately and call 311 Seniors should take extra care outdoors to avoid slips and falls from icy conditions Protect yourself and your family from carbon monoxide CO poisoninghttpwww1nycgovassetsdohdownloadspdfpublicdohmhnews1001pdf Make sure your home has a working smoke alarm and CO detector If a CO detector goes off in your home immediately open a nearby window go outside for fresh air and call 911 NEVER run a vehicle inside a garage or against a snowbank Clear snow from your cars tailpipe before running the engine Check on neighbors friends and relatives For more information on preparing for weather hazards including heat cold coastal storms and power outages visit the DOHMH extreme weather websitehttpwww1nycgovsitedohhealthemergencypreparednessthreatspage Key Messages About 80 of heat stroke victims in New York City are overcome by excessively hot conditions in their own homes as indoor temperatures in the urban environment may be even hotter than outdoor temperatures when an air conditioner is not available or not in use Although heatrelated mortality rates are lower than in historical periods before electricity and air conditioning it is possible that rates may rise as a result of climate change depending on the extent of adaptation In 2011 a Health Department survey estimated that 25 of New York City adults still do not have or rarely use air conditioning during hot summer weather many of whom may be at increased risk of heat stress due to age or poor health People most likely to be exposed to dangerous cold include those who lack shelter work outdoors andor live in homes with malfunctioning or inadequate heat Seniors infants people with chronic cardiovascular or lung conditions people using alcohol or drugs and people with cognitive impairments or mental health conditions are at increased risk"},{"title":"Worker

these preventable events occur and to identify factors that place workers at risk These data are also used to design target and evaluate prevention strategies and regulations that aim to keep workers safe and healthy Work Workplaces and Health Highquality work benefits physical and mental health in a variety of ways In addition to economic benefits work can be a source of identity and pride an avenue for social participation and a way to learn new skills Individuals who work have lower rates of illness and live longer than those who are unemployed On the other hand unfavorable work environments expose workers to serious health hazards which regularly result in injury illness disability and death Although many factors contribute to worker health such as workplace design organization worker characteristics and culture it is the employers responsibility to provide safe and healthful workplaces for their workers Preventing Workplace Injury and Disease Both workers and employers play important roles in keeping workplaces safe and healthy Employers should Demonstrate and communicate an ongoing commitment to safety and wellbeing Eliminate known hazards if possible and

quality","pollution","PM2.5","traffic","breathing","asthma","heart disease","lung disease","stroke"],"href":"/data_stories/breatheeasy","content":" NYCs air quality has improved The air we breathe can have a major effect on our health air pollution can make asthma worse and can cause heart disease lung disease strokes and even cancer Fortunately New York City has made great strides in recent years to improve air quality Lets take a look raw HTML within An air quality advisory day happens when air pollution builds up to dangerous levels It means that people who are sensitive to air pollution like people with respiratory or heart problems should spend less time outside and avoid outdoor exercise If the air quality is bad enough then most people will be affected by it Over the years though the number of advisory days has gone down Thats good news for everyone who breathes Whats behind this improvement Since the winter of 20082009 the Health Department has been measuring air quality through the NYC Community Air Survey NYCCAS Its the largest urban air monitoring program in the USA and measures six different kinds of air pollution at about 100 locations around the city raw HTML within Because of NYCCAS weve been able to measure improvements in air quality that are in part due to City regulations and policies For example Efforts by the City to phase out residual heating oil the dirtiest kind have helped wintertime levels of sulfur dioxide go down by 96 percent Citywide average levels for 4 other pollutants have gone down by between 26 and 44 percent A closer look at PM25 in the air One major component of air pollution Fine particles in the air called PM25 We breathe them in and they enter our lungs and bloodstream where they can cause health problems In New York City the current PM25 levels contribute to an estimated 2300 deaths from lung and heart disease each year That means about 1 out of every 20 deaths in New York City is due to this type of air pollution So its good news that since monitoring neighborhoodlevel air pollution began in 2009 the levels of PM25 have steadily gone down which you can see in the chart below raw HTML within By burning heating oil New York Citys buildings are responsible for about 50 percent of the citys PM25 emissions and traffic is responsible for another 17 percent see a data story on the Public Health Impacts of PM25 from Air Pollution That means that reducing traffic and working to make sure that buildings burn cleaner fuel are great ways to clean up the air and help keep our air cleaner and both are important parts of OneNYC the citys sustainability plan But since 45 percent of PM25 in NYC comes from outside the city rollbacks of federal regulations like the Clean Power Plan will also affect the quality of our air The City is providing comments to the Environmental Protection Agency in support of stricter emissions standards for power plants cars and trucks so that NYCs air quality continues to improve PM25 is only one piece of the puzzle While NYCCAS has let us see ways that air quality has improved it also identifies areas where we can make better progress For example weve learned that Average ozone levels in the summer havent changed in the past 10 years There are higher levels of pollutants in areas of higher traffic density building density and in industrial areas Measuring air quality means we can track improvements and challenges and push for changes in our city and the nation that will reduce air pollution and keep New Yorkers healthy Here at the Health Department well continue monitoring air quality just as we measure levels of asthma heart disease and lung disease that can be attributed in part to air pollution As air quality improves we expect decreases in disease rates

one neighborhood Its horizontal position represents the neighborhoods poverty rate and its vertical position represents its asthma rate The pattern of dots roughly grouped around an ascending line shows a connection between poverty and asthma the higher the poverty rate the higher the asthma rate raw HTML within Why does this connection exist The connection between poverty and asthma is due to a variety of factors including A shortage of healthy housing in poor neighborhoods means that people experience a range of housing conditions like mold pests and leaks that trigger asthma and make it worse A lack of access to highquality health care means that people with asthma may not be on the right medicine to prevent attacks This Epi Data
