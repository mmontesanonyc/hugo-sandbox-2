Bad air quality can be particularly dangerous for older adults, children, and people with heart or lung conditions.
Air quality varies from neighborhood to neighborhood, based on local levels of emissions and many other factors. We monitor air quality using the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), NYC&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive air quality monitoring and modeling network.</description></item><item><title>NYCCAS report</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/key_topics/airquality/nyccas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 11:14:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/key_topics/airquality/nyccas/</guid><description>NYCCAS Report Goes Here.</description></item><item><title>Your Neighborhood's Air Quality</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/key_topics/airquality/aqe/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 12:04:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/key_topics/airquality/aqe/</guid><description>We combine data from our air quality monitoring network, NYCCAS, with other data to understand what makes one neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s air quality different from another&amp;rsquo;s. We found that building emissions, building density, industrial areas, and traffic density are associated with differences in air quality.
If we don&amp;rsquo;t have an air quality monitor in one neighborhood, but we know its building density, its industrial area, and its traffic, then we can model (estimate or predict) its air quality - based on monitored air quality in similar neighborhoods.</description></item><item><title>Air Quality</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/air-quality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/air-quality/</guid><description>Air quality is a measure of the condition of the air around us. The less air pollution there is, the better the air quality.
Like many cities, New York City&amp;rsquo;s air contains particles, liquid droplets, gases, and other contaminants that could impact health. Two pollutants, particulate matter andground-level ozone, are of particular health concern.
Although New York City&amp;rsquo;s air does not currently meet federal air quality standards, it has improved significantly over the past two decades.</description></item><item><title>Health Impacts of Air Pollution</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/health-impacts-of-air-pollution/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/health-impacts-of-air-pollution/</guid><description>Air pollution is an important environmental threat to the health of New York City residents. Exposures to two common air pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3), can worsen respiratory illness and heart conditions and contribute to premature deaths. Older adults, children and people with existing heart and lung disease are especially affected. This site provides estimates of the impact of air pollution on the health of NYC residents as measured by the numbers of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths attributable to PM2.</description></item><item><title>Large City Air Quality Comparison</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/large-city-air-quality-comparison/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/large-city-air-quality-comparison/</guid><description>OneNYC is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City&amp;rsquo;s future.
Goal: Achieve the cleanest air quality of any big United States (US) city.
To measure progress towards this goal, we are tracking atmospheric concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) in NYC compared to other large cities (populations greater than 1 million) in the US.
Air Quality and Sustainability Particulate matter is a complex mixture of very small solids and droplets suspended in air.</description></item><item><title>Traffic</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/traffic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/traffic/</guid><description>Coming soon</description></item><item><title>Transportation</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/transportation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/transportation/</guid><description>OneNYC is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City&amp;rsquo;s future.
Goal: Expand sustainable transportation choices and ensure the reliability and quality of our transportation network.
To measure progress towards this goal, we are tracking the switch to more sustainable modes of transportation (modal shift) and mass transit capacity, as well as whether our transportation system is meeting a state of good repair.
Modal Shift We are tracking the extent to which people are using non-automobile modes of transit including public transportation (e.</description></item><item><title>Transportation-related Injuries</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/transportation-related-injuries/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_explorer/transportation-related-injuries/</guid><description>Traffic injuries are no accident. Like other public health concerns, they are preventable through data driven solutions. In NYC, traffic injuries, which include injuries among pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and motor vehicle occupants, are a leading cause of injury-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits.
In February 2014, NYC launched “Vision Zero”, an action plan to reduce injuries and deaths on city streets. Vision Zero is a multi-agency effort, incorporating road engineering, traffic enforcement, community outreach and education, and policy work to make NYC streets safer.</description></item><item><title>Tracking changes in New York City's sources of air pollution</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_stories/aq-cooking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 12:02:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_stories/aq-cooking/</guid><description>As city life changes, so does its air quality, as sources of emissions that affect the city&amp;rsquo;s outdoor air quality, like truck traffic, building boilers and restaurants, also change. For more than a decade, we have been tracking air quality through the NYC Community Air Survey (NYCCAS) and exploring the factors that drive neighborhood differences. We have found some interesting changes in the sources of air pollution across NYC neighborhoods.</description></item><item><title>Breathe easy: NYC's air quality is improving</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_stories/breatheeasy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2019 08:18:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox-2/data_stories/breatheeasy/</guid><description>The air we breathe can have a major effect on our health — air pollution can make asthma worse and can cause heart disease, lung disease, strokes, and even cancer.
Fortunately, New York City has made great strides in recent years to improve air quality. Let’s take a look.
