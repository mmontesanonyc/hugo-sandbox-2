We found that building emissions, building density, industrial areas, and traffic density are associated with differences in air quality.
If we don&amp;rsquo;t have an air quality monitor in one neighborhood, but we know its building density, its industrial area, and its traffic, then we can model (estimate or predict) its air quality - based on monitored air quality in similar neighborhoods.</description></item><item><title>Tracking changes in New York City's sources of air pollution</title><link>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox/data_stories/aq-cooking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 12:02:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/hugo-sandbox/data_stories/aq-cooking/</guid><description>As city life changes, so does its air quality, as sources of emissions that affect the city&amp;rsquo;s outdoor air quality, like truck traffic, building boilers and restaurants, also change. For more than a decade, we have been tracking air quality through the NYC Community Air Survey (NYCCAS) and exploring the factors that drive neighborhood differences. We have found some interesting changes in the sources of air pollution across NYC neighborhoods.</description></item></channel></rss>
